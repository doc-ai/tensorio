## Tensor/IO Examples

### Notebooks

Example code demonstrating how to build models for use with tensor/io. Code is versioned by backend. Each model is accompanied by an example tensor/io *model.json* file that shows how to create the *model.json* based on the model's layer names, signature definition, and other named operations in the model.

### iOS

Example iOS code showing how to use each of the models built by the notebooks. Example code is contained in tests and not in the application itself.
